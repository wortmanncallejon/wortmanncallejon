Hi, Iâ€™m Felix @wortmanncallejon and I am a MSc candidate in Political Science and Political Economy at the Department of Government of the London School of Economics and Political Science. I am interested in the cirucmstances under which climate policy succeeds and political behaviour in times crises more broadly. For my research, I use quantitative methods such as text-as-data, causal inference, and multi-level modeling. I am profficient in <code>R</code>, <code>STATA</code> and <code>SPSS</code>.
Outside of my research, I love to cook, drink espresso, and cycle.
