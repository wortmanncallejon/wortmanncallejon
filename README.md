Hi, Iâ€™m Felix @wortmanncallejon and I am an undergraduate political science student at FU Berlin.
I am interested in the supply and demand sides of elections (e.g. parties and voters), as well as electoral- and political systems more broadly.
I also focus on quantitative methods and most of my research is done in <code>R</code>, although I also have experience with <code>SPSS</code>.
Outside of my research, I love to cook, drink espresso, and cycle.
