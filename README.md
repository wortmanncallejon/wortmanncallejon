# Hi,
<br>
Iâ€™m Felix <code>@wortmanncallejon</code> and I am a political economist and data scientist.

I am a consultant at the economic policy advisory firm TWS Partners, where I employ game- and auction theoretic tools to help clients in strategic business settings, e.g. procurement, sales, company strategy.

From September 2023 to September 2024, I was Junior Associate at Bernstein Group, where I curated, cleaned, and analysed political and economic data using machine learning methods, as well as frequentist- and bayesian statistics to help domestic and international clients get the best out of their data.

Prior to that, I was a graduate student of political science at the Department of Government of the [London School of Economics and Political Science](https://www.lse.ac.uk/).

For my research I rely on quantitative methodology - especially causal inference - which I implement in <code>R</code>. I am also profficient in <code>STATA</code>,  <code>SPSS</code>, and, increasingly, `Python`.

Outside of work, I love to ride my bicycle (preferably in the mountains), play volleyball, cook, and drink espresso.
