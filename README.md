# Hi,

I am Felix <code>@wortmanncallejon</code>, a PhD student in Political Economy at <a href="https://rppe.princeton.edu/">Princeton University</a>. I am interested in explaining variation in the time horizon of investive policies. Specifically, I use formal theory, machine learning- and causal inference methods to understand which factors enable long-term policymaking, with applications ranging from climate policy to AI safety. Methodologically, I am interested in studying when empirical measurements are commensurate with theory, that is studying the <a href="https://stephanewolton.com/about/tiem/">theoretical implications of empirical models (TIEM)</a>.

I hold a Master's degree in Political Science and Political Economy from the <a href="https://www.lse.ac.uk/government/research/research-groups/political-science-and-political-economy">London School of Economics</a>, as well as Bachelor's degree from the <a href="https://www.polsoz.fu-berlin.de/polwiss/index.html">Free University of Berlin</a>. From September 2023 through May 2025, I worked in the private sector as a data science and game theory consultant.

Outside of work, I love to ride my bicycle (preferably in the mountains), play volleyball, cook, and drink espresso.
