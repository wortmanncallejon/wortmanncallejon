Hi, Iâ€™m Felix <code>@wortmanncallejon</code> and I am a Junior Associate at [Bernstein Gropu](https://bernstein-group.com/en/), where I curate, clean, and analyse political and economic data using machine learning methods, as well as frequentist- and bayesian statistics to help domestic and international clients get the best out of their data. Prior to that, I was a graduate student of political science at the Department of Government of the [London School of Economics and Political Science](https://www.lse.ac.uk/). For my research I rely on quantitative methodology - especially causal inference - which I implement in <code>R</code>. I am also profficient in <code>STATA</code>,  <code>SPSS</code>, and, increasingly `Python`.Outside of my research, I love to ride my bicycle (preferably in the mountains), play volleyball, cook, and drink espresso.

You can reach me [@wortmanncallejo](https://twitter.com/wortmanncallejo) or via [E-Mail](mailto:felix@wortmanncallejon.de).
